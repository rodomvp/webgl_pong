    		For this final project, I decided to combine elements of what we have learned all semester and apply them to what I truly want to do with all of this new technology and information: which is to make games. Because of this I decided to try and implement my own 3D version of Pong to teach myself game building basics and also to learn about the physics of WebGL. However, this is not exactly the most groundbreaking idea for a project so I needed a way to make it more interesting. Because of this I decided to attempt to bind a video texture to the table mesh to show a video on the game table while the game is played. Because of that, this was a learning experience both on the game-making side as well as the graphics implementation side.</p>
    	<p>
    		I chose to use Three.js to implement the project for a couple of reasons. Three.js does an excellent job of abstracting away many of the details of WebGL. Three.js does a lot of the repetitive bits for you: internally it’s generating WebGL code while exposing a simpler API. Three.js also has pre-built components and helper methods that I used to help expedite the process of making the game. Finally, a large part of the reason that I used Three.js was because it is real-world – it’s important to know how to use libraries that change up the way you are used to doing things as long as they make you more efficient. </p>
    		<p>The process of building the game was relatively straightforward as far as programming goes. First I started by building the scene in my createScene() method. In here, we set up the camera and it’s view angle of the scene. Then we start setting up the components that make up the scene. This process starts by creating all of the materials that will be applied to the objects in the scene. After we have the materials created we are ready to start building the object meshes. We make the meshes and bind the material to the geometry to create our models. For our gameplay plane and the table, we allow them to receive the shadows cast by the ball and/or paddles. After the models are completed and added to the scene we reposition them to their final place in the scene. We set the ball to start in the middle of the board and the paddles in the middle of the tables. We also set up a point light and a spot light, to show off the shadows of our model. We enable shadow mapping and add our lights to the scene. For the basic rendering of our scene, these are all of the necessary components.</p>
    		<p>However, getting the video to render on the table was a different beast entirely. Essentially the way that it works is that we render the first frame of the video onto the texture, but then must update it every frame of the video until completion. This means that we are going to have to update our draw() function. That being said, let us first examine how we set up the video texture. First we create a video element on the document, and load our source video into that element. Then we load and play the video. Next we create a canvas for the video to be projected on to, and set the size of the canvas according to the size of our table. Then we create a 2d context for the video. Finally, We build the texture and add Linear filters. Finally, we build the final material out of the final texture product and bind the material to the game-playing plane. </p>
    		<p>The gameplay aspects were also difficult to program, but are fairly straightforward. We have to handle the beginning of the game, scoring of a point, and ending of a game. At the beginning of the game and after the scoring of a point, the ball starts in the middle of the game-playing plane. After the final point is scored the game is terminated and a refresh is required in order to continue playing. </p>
    		<p>Unfortunately, I was not able to get Google Chrome working with the program, but was able to get Safari as well as Firefox to function as expected. </p>
